# hangman_node

A command prompt node.js hangman game.

You must install npm modules for the game to function

enter index.js at the node prompt to start game.

This app makes use of the npm "faker" module to randomly pick the secret word. The odds of seeing the same word twice are extremely low. It also makes it impossible to cheat by viewing the word list.

Have fun and good luck!
